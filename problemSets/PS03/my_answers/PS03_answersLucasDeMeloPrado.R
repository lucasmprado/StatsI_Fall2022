# QUESTION 1
############

# 1. Run a regression where the outcome variable is voteshare and the explanatory variable is difflog:
lm_q1 <- lm(voteshare ~ difflog, data = dat)
summary(lm_q1)
stargazer(lm_q1, title="The effect of the difference in campaign spending
          between incumbent and challenger on the incumbent's vote share",
          column.labels = "Incumbent's vote share",
          covariate.labels = "Difference in campaign spending")

# 2. Make a scatterplot of the two variables and add the regression line:
png("lm_q1.png", 640, 480)
dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(difflog, voteshare)) +
  geom_point(color="gray35") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") +
  xlab("Difference in campaign spending between incumbent and challenger") +
  ylab("Incumbent's vote share") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 16), axis.title = element_text(size = 16))
dev.off()

# 3. Save the residuals of the model in a separate object:
lm_q1_res <- lm_q1$residuals

# 1. Run a regression where the outcome variable is presvote and the explanatory variable is difflog:

          covariate.labels = "Vote share of the presidential candidate of
          the incumbent's party")

# QUESTION 4

# 1. Run a regression where the outcome variable is the residuals from Question 1
# and the explanatory variable is the residuals from Question 2:
lm_q4 <- lm(lm_q1_res ~ lm_q2_res)
summary(lm_q4)
stargazer(lm_q4, title="The association between the residuals from
          Question 1 and Question 2",
          column.labels = "Residuals from Question 1",
          covariate.labels = "Residuals from Question 2")

# 2. Make a scatterplot of the two residuals and add the regression line:
